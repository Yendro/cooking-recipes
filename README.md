# Odin-Recipes Project 🍳

This is a small HTML project where I created a main index (`index.html`) linking to three different cooking recipes. Each recipe includes an ingredient list, preparation steps, an image of the dish, and a link back to the index.

## Project Features ✨

- **Homepage (`index.html`)** with links to three recipes.
- Three recipe pages (`bolognese.html`, `omelette.html`, `cocktail.html`).
- Use of semantic HTML elements.
- Unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients.
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) for preparation steps.
- Images (`<img>`) of each dish.
- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure content.
- Link in each recipe to return to the index (home).

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- HTML5
- Markdown (for this README)
